##Breast Cancer Prediciton

The Breast Cancer Prediction is a small python preoject to test out a model that is suitable to work with the data present.

We are trying to achieve at least 80% accuracy with the preiction model.

We are trying to implement the Linear regression model in the master branch. We will later create a branch called dev-model, where will try and implement the SVM model and see how the accuracy is affected.
